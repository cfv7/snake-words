# Snake Words

## Summary:
Create a python tool that scrapes any given url and outputs the top five most popular words

## Technology:
This tool uses Python's Requests & BeautifulSoup libraries

## Process:
* get the text from a webpage
* parse the text into strings
* put the strings into a container
* use the Counter functionality to total up most common
* use regular expressions via python's re module

## Future:
* get it running in a flask framework so that it can be used client side
* if not, just beef up it's command line utility
* eventually I hope to work on a web spider and learn more about robot exclusion standard
